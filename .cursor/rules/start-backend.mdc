# Start Backend When Asked

When the user says they want to **start the app**, **run the backend**, **run the server**, or **start the project** (or similar), automatically run these commands in the terminal:

1. **PowerShell** (Windows):  
   `cd "c:\recovery saas\ai-lead-recovery\backend"; npm install; npm start`  
   Run `npm start` in the **background** (so the server keeps running).

2. If the user has not started the backend and is about to test the app or open the frontend, proactively run the backend start command in the background.

Use the run_terminal_cmd (or equivalent) tool with the backend path and `npm start` in background when the user requests starting/running the app or server.
